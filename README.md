# Spectrogram
This is a fun collaborative project with the aim at predicting whether a song fits the audio characteristics of being famous or not. 

We have taken top songs (rap at the moment) along with songs with high dislike/like ratio (youtube) and converted each into **spectrograms**. Each file is then seperated into different folders with their appropriate labels. *fire/trash* 'slang' for good or bad. 

To simple experiment with this project **git clone** this repository & run each *jupyter notebook* in order!
